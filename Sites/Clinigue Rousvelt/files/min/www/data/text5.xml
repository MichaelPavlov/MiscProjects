Like they say on cooking shows, "Here's one I prepared earlier". The image below is a screenshot of a template that has the same content as this one but with a different background and some setting changes. </p><br/>
<p>
The full list of XML and CSS changes made to get to this design are:</p>
<p>
<li>Added a new darker background image to the bgimages folder and set this as the background.</li>
<li>Inverted the theme by setting the invert attribute to 1.</li>
<li>Changed the base color to a bright yellow and the composite color to a steel grey.</li>
<li>Added two CSS color 'overrides' to make the color of the footer and the content border a better yellow.</li>
<li>Increased the alpha of the content background to 90.</li>
</p>
